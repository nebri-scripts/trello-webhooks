# trello_webhooks
Trello Webhook App for NebriOS

This app is intended for use in a NebriOS instance. Visit https://nebrios.com to sign up for free!

<h4>Setup</h4>
Please ensure that all files are placed in the correct places over SFTP.
  - `trello_handle_card_archived`, `trello_handle_card_deleted.py`, `trello_notify_email.py`, `trello_watch_boards_for_user.py` and `trello_webhook_steup.py` should be copied to /scripts
  - `trello_webhook.py` should be copied to /api
  - `trello-token-save.html` should be copied to /card_html_files

Over ssh, install the following requirement using pip:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/sarumont/py-trello
```

Once all files are properly uploaded, this app needs to be set up from debug mode.

If this is the first time setting up these webhooks, a trello api key/secret pair will need to be supplied. This pair can be acquired at https://trello.com/1/appkey/generate. You must be logged in to trello to generate an app key/secret pair.
  ```
  trello_webhook_setup := True
  trello_api_key := <api_key>
  trello_api_secret := <api_secret>
  instance_name := <instance_name>
  past_due_notify_address := <past_due_notify_email_address>
  completed_notify_address := <completed_notify_email_address>
  ```
This will trigger a card load with a link to follow that will provide you with a token generated with your app key/secret. The generated token will be stored for future use.

Once you submit the card, setup is complete. At this point, data will automatically be received from trello based on events that happen on the user's boards and will update appropriate KVPs accordingly.

<h4>Usage</h4>
There are a few different ticket scenarios that are currently covered by this app: notifications when a ticket is completed, notifications when a ticket has become past due, and notifications for when a card has been archived.

Each scenario has it's own rule script to send out notifications. These rule scripts can be triggered manually for testing, or can be set up to run on a drip schedule.

<strong>Manually Triggering Scripts</strong>
  ```
  trello_notify_email := completed
  ```
  When the above line is sent via debug mode, the `trello_notify_email` script will be woken up, causing it to find all completed cards and send an email listing all cards completed in the last 24 hours. An email will be sent to the address defined during setup in the `completed_notify_address` KVP.
  
  ```
  trello_notify_email := due
  ```
  When the above line is sent via debug mode, the `trello_notify_email` script will be woken up, causing it to find all cards that were due in the past 24 hours and send an email listing the found cards. An email will be sent to the address defined during setup in the `past_due_notify_address` KVP.

<strong>Setting Up a Drip</strong>

Under advanced in the nebrios web app, there is a drips tab. This can also be accessed at the `/core/drip/` endpoint.
Drips utilize cron job syntax for when they are run (www.cronmaker.com):
  ```
   * * * * *  command to execute
   │ │ │ │ │
   │ │ │ │ │
   │ │ │ │ └───── day of week (0 - 6) (0 to 6 are Sunday to Saturday, or use names; 7 is Sunday, the same as 0)
   │ │ │ └────────── month (1 - 12)
   │ │ └─────────────── day of month (1 - 31)
   │ └──────────────────── hour (0 - 23)
   └───────────────────────── min (0 - 59)
  ```
  
  `schedule` should reflect the cron schedule in the above syntax
  `key/value pairs` should reflect what key/value pairs should be created
  
  <strong>Example</strong> In order to create a drip to run `trello_notify_email`, to send a list of completed tickets every day at 8am, your drip should look like:
      
      schedule: 0 8 * * *
      key/value pairs: trello_notify_email := completed
